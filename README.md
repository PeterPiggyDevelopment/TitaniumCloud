##Make and launch
If you want to launch server, you should make the project. 
To make it you should install **Glassgow Haskell Compiler**, **Cabal** and **Make**. Then '**cd**' to your clone directory, install all cabal project dependencies and run '**make**'. Server will be made and run.

Then you can open **localhost:8888** and it will cause connect to the server.
